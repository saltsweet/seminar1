# **Berova Veronika**
## *Description*
***

+ so, to begin with, my name differs from traditional russian names such as Masha, Dasha, Olya. i’m Veronika. actually, the stress is on the third syllable (i), but i like telling people ~~it is on the second (o) so that it starts sounding more unusual for our people~

- honestly, i don’t know why i started talking about **education**, but all in all it’s really wide and interesting theme, especially, we are living in different cultural areas.

+ our educational system consists of 11 years studying at school, 5 of them are for primary school and the other 6 are for secondary. we don’t have concept of “high school”, but in fact two last years, 10th and 11th forms can be identified so. after 11th form we pass state exam, whereby we ourselves choose subjects to pass according to our future academic course. only russian language and mathematics are obligatory, and in two years our government wants to add english there too. of course, some universities also have entrance exams and they are more difficult to be passed successfully but in the other hand it’s an obvious indicator of potential students abilities.

- i finished school and entered the university this september. as i told you, my program is about **foreign languages**, cross-cultural communication, including business-communication, translating and theory and strategy of teaching. yes, this is humanitarian course and we also have philosophy classes, and i really love them, but i appreciate your attitudes in engineering and understand why you think philosophy is a dumb:)) i have a strong interest in: computer science, i try programming and visualization of data, but i had problems with maths at school, so i didn’t have a chance to enter the program which is connected with computers. however, i know my strengths and weaknesses, and i like languages too, so i don’t regret.

+ talking about other hobbies, now i am interested in:
1. design,
2. science
3. all forms of art
4. reading, especially philosophy
1. in area, which seems strange for russian people so far, gender sociology.
